## Hi there 👋

## 👩‍💻 Hello! I'm Fatma Isiyok. (Nick name: Fifi)

I'm a Software Engineering student at Bay Atlantic University in Washington, DC.  
Currently in my second semester, I'm learning HTML through my Web Development course and previously studied Java in my first semester.  

I’m highly curious and passionate about learning. I might not have projects (yet), but I love solving problems — even if it takes 4 hours and all the errors in the world. That's how I grow.

---

### 🌱 What I'm learning:
- Java
- HTML & Web Fundamentals
- Patience & persistence through coding mistakes 🙃

---

### 🎯 Goals:
Right now, my top priority is to find an **internship**.  
I believe the best learning happens through hands-on experience.  
I’m open to every opportunity that helps me grow — no matter the direction.

### 🎧 A bit about me:
- I love coding while listening to music in cafes
- I enjoy the challenge of debugging (seriously!)
- I’m patient and persistent, even when it gets tough
- I may not know where I’m going yet — but I’m running towards it full speed 🚀
